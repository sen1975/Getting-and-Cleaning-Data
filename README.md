# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

# Data Set Information
Experiment were carried on 30 people, of age group 19-48 years. Each of them performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II). 
The embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, captured the acceleration and the velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.
The dataset is randomly partitioned into two,  70% of them where for training dataset and 30% for test data.

# Attribute Information
For each record in the dataset it is provided:
Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
